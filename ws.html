        WHO IS HE ?
    </i>
</h2>
<p>
    <u>William Shakespeare is widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language</u>. He was born on or around 23 April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, the eldest son of John Shakespeare, a prosperous glover and local dignitary, and Mary Arden, the daughter of a wealthy farmer. There are no records of Williams education, but he probably went to Kings New School a reputable Stratford grammar school where he would have learned Latin, Greek, theology and rhetoric and may have had a Catholic upbringing. <mark>He may also have seen plays by the travelling theatre groups touring Stratford in the 1560s and 70s. At 18</mark>, William married Anne Hathaway, and the couple had three children over the next few years.
